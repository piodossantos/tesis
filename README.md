# Experiencia de Usuario a partir de grabación de video usando Computer Vision

This repository contains the source code and associated resources for a master's postgraduate thesis in Big Data at Universidad ORT. The work presented here is the result of research conducted by Leandro Patrón, Pío dos Santos, and Marcelo Mandirola, focused on developing an advanced framework for the categorization and grouping of images through the use of computer vision techniques and deep learning.

## Description

The research proposes an innovative approach for the semantic interpretation and compositional structure of images, integrating traditional computer vision techniques with modern artificial intelligence strategies. The main goal is to enrich the process of identifying semantic patterns and their effective classification, which facilitates automatic grouping and improves the organization of large visual data sets.

## Main Challenges

- **Detection of User Interaction Elements:** Identifying key components in videos that document user experiences.
- **Frame Grouping:** Classifying video frames based on their semantic content, employing cutting-edge artificial intelligence techniques for this purpose.

## Key Repository Components

- **Experiments.ipynb:** The main notebook where all defined experiments are run.
- **ui.py:** A script to run the user interface designed for interacting with the models and visualizing results.
- **[Paper](https://bibliotecas.ort.edu.uy/):** Access to the full document that details the methodology and findings of the research. (Note: The paper is in Spanish.)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have all necessary dependencies installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. To run the experiments, execute the `Experiments.ipynb` notebook.
4. To start the user interface, execute `python ui.py` from the command line.
